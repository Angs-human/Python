    "### What is Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers (ORM), form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework-related tools.\n",

    "### What is App Routing in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions in a Flask application. The `@app.route` decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL to a function, so when a user accesses a specific URL, the corresponding function is executed. This function typically returns the response that the user sees in their browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Use App Routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL Management**:\n",
    "   - App routes help manage the URLs of your application, defining which function should be called for which URL. This makes it easy to handle different parts of a web application by organizing routes logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clear and Readable Code**:\n",
    "   - By using decorators to define routes, the code becomes more readable and maintainable. Developers can easily see which URL is mapped to which function, improving the clarity of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modularity**:\n",
    "   - App routes allow for a modular approach to web application development. Different routes can handle different functionalities, making it easier to develop, test, and debug parts of the application separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic URL Building**:\n",
    "   - Flask's routing system supports dynamic URL building, allowing URLs to include variable parts (e.g., `/user/<username>`). This makes it possible to create dynamic web applications that respond to different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Functionality Mapping**:\n",
    "   - Routes map specific URLs to specific functions, ensuring that the correct logic is executed for each URL. This mapping is essential for creating interactive and responsive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RESTful API Development**:\n",
    "   - App routes are crucial for building RESTful APIs. Each route can correspond to a different endpoint in the API, handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform various operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of App Routing in Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example to illustrate app routing in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to the Home Page!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return 'This is the About Page.'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def show_user_profile(username):\n",
    "    return f'User: {username}'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `/` route is mapped to the `home` function, which returns the home page content.\n",
    "- The `/about` route is mapped to the `about` function, which returns the about page content.\n",
    "- The `/user/<username>` route is mapped to the `show_user_profile` function, which takes a `username` parameter and returns a user profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining these routes, Flask knows which function to call when each URL is accessed. This mechanism allows developers to create structured and organized web applications."

    "In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used for URL building. This function is helpful in creating URLs for specific functions within your application, ensuring that your links remain consistent even if you change the structure of your routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `url_for()` function takes the name of the function as its first argument and any number of keyword arguments corresponding to the variables in the URL rule. It is particularly useful for generating URLs dynamically and avoiding hardcoding paths in your templates or views.\n",

    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Home Route**:\n",
    "   - The root URL (`/`) is mapped to the `home` function.\n",
    "   - The `home` function generates links to the \"About Page\" and \"User Page\" using `url_for()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **About Route**:\n",
    "   - The `/about` URL is mapped to the `about` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Profile Route**:\n",
    "   - The `/user/<username>` URL is mapped to the `user_profile` function, which takes a `username` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Flask Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save the above code to a file, e.g., `app.py`.\n",
    "2. Run the application using a terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   python app.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. The application will start a local development server. You should see output similar to this:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.\n",
    "- You will see the home page with links to the \"About Page\" and \"User Page\".\n",
    "- Clicking on these links will take you to the respective pages, demonstrating the use of the `url_for()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying the Output in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Since running a Flask server and interacting with it directly is not feasible in this notebook environment, I'll provide a script for your local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Script for Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the script again for your local setup:\n",
    "\n",
