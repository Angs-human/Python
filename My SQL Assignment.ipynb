    "## What is a Database?\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage large amounts of information by enabling storage, retrieval, updating, and management of data in a structured way. They can range from simple text files to complex systems with structured data in various formats. Databases are essential for many applications, including websites, business operations, scientific research, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL vs. NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL (Relational) Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Structure:**\n",
    "- **Schema:** SQL databases use a predefined schema, which defines tables and the relationships between them. The schema ensures data integrity and enforces rules about the structure of the data.\n",
    "- **Tables:** Data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns, where each column represents an attribute, and each row represents a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Query Language:**\n",
    "- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** SQL is used for defining and manipulating data. Common SQL commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, and `ALTER`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Examples:**\n",
    "- MySQL\n",
    "- PostgreSQL\n",
    "- Oracle Database\n",
    "- Microsoft SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. ACID Compliance:**\n",
    "- SQL databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure reliable transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Structure:**\n",
    "- **Dynamic Schema:** NoSQL databases use a dynamic schema for unstructured data, allowing for more flexible and scalable data models.\n",
    "- **Data Models:** There are several types of NoSQL databases, each with a different data model:\n",
    "  - **Document Stores:** Store data as JSON or BSON documents (e.g., MongoDB).\n",
    "  - **Key-Value Stores:** Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).\n",
    "  - **Column-Family Stores:** Store data in columns rather than rows (e.g., Apache Cassandra).\n",
    "  - **Graph Databases:** Store data as nodes, edges, and properties to represent and traverse relationships (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Query Language:**\n",
    "- **Varies by Database:** NoSQL databases often use different query languages and APIs. For example, MongoDB uses a query language that is JSON-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Examples:**\n",
    "- MongoDB\n",
    "- Cassandra\n",
    "- Redis\n",
    "- Couchbase\n",
    "- Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. BASE Properties:**\n",
    "- NoSQL databases often follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, which provides high availability and partition tolerance but may sacrifice immediate consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Schema:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Fixed schema with predefined tables and relationships.\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Flexible schema with dynamic data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Scalability:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Typically vertically scalable (requires increasing the capacity of a single server).\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Typically horizontally scalable (requires adding more servers to handle increased load).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Transactions:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Strong support for multi-record transactions with ACID compliance.\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Varies, with some offering limited transaction support, focusing more on scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use Cases:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Suitable for complex queries, transactions, and applications requiring strong consistency and relational data models (e.g., financial systems).\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Suitable for large-scale data storage, real-time web applications, and use cases requiring high availability and flexible data models (e.g., social networks, big data applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Data Integrity:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Enforces data integrity and relationships through foreign keys and constraints.\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Offers more flexibility but requires careful design to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Query Language:**\n",
    "- **SQL:** Standardized language (SQL) for querying and managing data.\n",
    "- **NoSQL:** Varies by database, often using custom APIs or query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications requiring structured data, complex queries, and strong consistency. In contrast, NoSQL databases are ideal for applications needing flexible data models, high scalability, and high availability."

    "## What is DDL?\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. DDL statements are used to create, alter, and delete these objects. The primary DDL commands are `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, and `TRUNCATE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DDL Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `CREATE`\n",
    "The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, or schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a new table named `employees` with columns for `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `hire_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `DROP`\n",
    "The `DROP` command is used to delete existing database objects. This action is irreversible and will permanently remove the object and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement deletes the `employees` table and all the data within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `ALTER`\n",
    "The `ALTER` command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement adds a new column named `salary` to the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `TRUNCATE`\n",
    "The `TRUNCATE` command is used to delete all the data from a table but keep the table structure intact. It is faster than the `DELETE` command because it does not log individual row deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement removes all records from the `employees` table but retains the table's structure for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CREATE`:** Used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas.\n",
    "- **`DROP`:** Used to delete existing database objects, permanently removing the object and its data.\n",
    "- **`ALTER`:** Used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding or deleting columns in a table.\n",
    "- **`TRUNCATE`:** Used to remove all data from a table quickly without deleting the table itself, retaining its structure for future use."

    "## Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed. A primary key must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness:** Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique.\n",
    "2. **Non-null:** Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "3. **Immutability:** The value of a primary key should not change once it is assigned.\n",
    "4. **Single Column or Composite:** A primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite key).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider a table named `employees`:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `employee_id` is the primary key for the `employees` table. Each `employee_id` must be unique and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "1. **Referential Integrity:** Ensures that the value in the foreign key column(s) matches a value in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "2. **Relationships:** Defines the relationship between two tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "3. **Cascading Actions:** Can define actions such as `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON UPDATE CASCADE`, which specify what happens to the foreign key records when the referenced primary key record is deleted or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider two tables: `employees` and `departments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`departments` table:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    department_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`employees` table with foreign key:**\n",

    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE,\n",
    "    department_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `department_id` in the `employees` table is a foreign key that references `department_id` in the `departments` table. This establishes a relationship between employees and departments, ensuring that each employee is assigned to a valid department.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connecting to the Database:**\n",
    "   - The `mysql.connector.connect()` function is used to establish a connection to the MySQL database. It takes several parameters such as `host`, `database`, `user`, and `password`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cursor Object (`cursor()`)**\n",
    "   - Once the connection is established, a cursor object is created using the `connection.cursor()` method.\n",
    "   - A cursor is an interface for interacting with the database. It allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Executing Queries (`execute()`)**\n",
    "   - The `cursor.execute()` method is used to execute a single SQL query. The query is passed as a string parameter to the `execute()` method.\n",
    "   - In the example, `cursor.execute(\"SELECT DATABASE();\")` executes a query to fetch the name of the current database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetching Results:**\n",
    "   - After executing a query, the `cursor.fetchone()` method fetches a single row from the result set of the query. If there are multiple rows, methods like `cursor.fetchall()` can be used to fetch all rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Errors:**\n",
    "   - The `try-except` block is used to handle any errors that might occur while connecting to the database or executing queries. The `Error` class from `mysql.connector` helps in catching and printing database-related errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Closing the Connection:**\n",
    "   - The `finally` block ensures that the database connection is properly closed using `connection.close()` and `cursor.close()` methods, even if an error occurs. This is important for resource management and to avoid potential database locks or connection leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **`cursor()`:** Creates a cursor object to interact with the database.\n",
    "- **`execute()`:** Executes a given SQL query using the cursor object."

    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is different from the order in which the clauses are written. Understanding this order is crucial for writing and optimizing SQL queries. Here is the logical order in which SQL clauses are executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**\n",
    "2. **JOIN**\n",
    "3. **WHERE**\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**\n",
    "5. **HAVING**\n",
    "6. **SELECT**\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT**\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY**\n",
    "9. **LIMIT / OFFSET**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**:\n",
    "   - The `FROM` clause specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data. It is the first clause to be executed as it identifies the source of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JOIN**:\n",
    "   - Any `JOIN` operations (such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc.) are performed next. These operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WHERE**:\n",
    "   - The `WHERE` clause filters the rows of the table(s) based on specified conditions. It is applied to each row in the table(s) and determines which rows will be included in the subsequent steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**:\n",
    "   - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the filtered rows based on one or more columns. It is used in conjunction with aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) to perform calculations on each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HAVING**:\n",
    "   - The `HAVING` clause filters the groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause based on specified conditions. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but operates on groups rather than individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SELECT**:\n",
    "   - The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns to be retrieved from the table(s). This is where the actual data to be displayed is selected, including any expressions or aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT**:\n",
    "   - The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that the returned rows are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY**:\n",
    "   - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns. It determines the order in which the rows are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **LIMIT / OFFSET**:\n",
    "   - The `LIMIT` clause (along with `OFFSET`) restricts the number of rows returned by the query. It is used for pagination and to limit the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following SQL query:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'\n",
    "GROUP BY department_id\n",
    "HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000\n",
    "ORDER BY average_salary DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FROM employees**: Identifies the source table `employees`.\n",
    "- **WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'**: Filters rows where the `hire_date` is after January 1, 2020.\n",
    "- **GROUP BY department_id**: Groups the filtered rows by `department_id`.\n",
    "- **HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000**: Filters the groups where the average salary is greater than 60000.\n",
    "- **SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary**: Selects the `department_id` and the calculated average salary for each group.\n",
    "- **DISTINCT**: Ensures the selected rows are unique.\n",
    "- **ORDER BY average_salary DESC**: Sorts the result set by the average salary in descending order.\n",
    "- **LIMIT 5**: Limits the result set to the top 5 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the logical order of execution helps in writing more efficient and accurate SQL queries."
