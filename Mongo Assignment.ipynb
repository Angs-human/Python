    "## What is MongoDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL (non-relational) database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed for scalability and developer agility, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of large volumes of data. MongoDB's schema-less nature means that the data structure can be changed over time without disrupting the existing data, which provides a high level of flexibility compared to traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Relational Databases in Short\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph formats. They do not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, they offer more flexibility and scalability for certain types of applications. Non-relational databases are typically used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, where the rigid schema of relational databases can be a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "- **Schema-less:** No fixed schema, allowing for dynamic changes to data structure.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Designed to scale out horizontally across many servers.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Supports various data models like document, key-value, graph, and column-family.\n",
    "- **High Performance:** Optimized for read and write performance, especially for big data applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - For real-time analytics and data processing, where performance and speed are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios Where SQL Databases Might Be Better:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Transactions:**\n",
    "   - When you need complex transactions involving multiple operations that require ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Relational Data:**\n",
    "   - When the data is highly structured and relational, and you need to enforce data integrity and relationships through foreign keys and joins.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Mature Tooling and Ecosystem:**\n",
    "   - When you need to leverage the mature ecosystem and extensive tooling available for SQL databases.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Business Intelligence:**\n",
    "   - For applications requiring advanced querying capabilities, reporting, and business intelligence tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is highly suitable for applications needing flexible, scalable, and high-performance data storage, particularly when dealing with unstructured data or rapidly evolving schemas. Traditional SQL databases are often more suitable for applications requiring complex transactions, strict data integrity, and advanced querying capabilities."

    "## Features of MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that offers several key features which make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Here are some of its primary features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Schema-less Database (Flexible Data Model)**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, allowing documents within a collection to have different fields and structures. This flexibility means you can store data in a way that best fits your application without being constrained by a fixed schema.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. **Document-Oriented Storage**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a binary representation of JSON-like documents. This allows for rich, nested data structures, making it easier to model complex data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Scalability and High Performance**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by sharding, which means distributing data across multiple servers. It also supports replication, allowing data to be duplicated across multiple servers for high availability and read scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Indexing**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB supports various types of indexing, including single-field, compound (multiple fields), geospatial, text, and hashed indexes. Indexing helps in querying data efficiently and improving read performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Aggregation Framework**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for advanced data processing and transformation operations, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and reshaping documents. It can perform complex data manipulations directly within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Replication and High Availability**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB supports replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability. Replica sets ensure automatic failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Sharding**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with large data sets and high throughput operations by partitioning data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Horizontal Scalability**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB can scale out by adding more servers to handle increased load and larger datasets. This horizontal scaling capability is essential for handling large-scale applications and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Geospatial Indexes and Queries**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB supports geospatial indexes for querying location-based data. It provides powerful geospatial querying capabilities, such as finding documents within a certain distance from a point or within a specific area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **ACID Transactions (Multi-Document Transactions)**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Starting with version 4.0, MongoDB supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions across multiple documents and collections. This allows developers to ensure data integrity and consistency during complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Text Search**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB provides text search capabilities, including text indexes and text search queries. This feature allows for efficient searching within text data, supporting features like text scoring and language-specific stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **File Storage**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files, such as images, videos, and audio files. GridFS divides files into smaller chunks and stores them as separate documents, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Aggregation Pipeline**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The aggregation pipeline allows for transforming and analyzing data in stages, providing a framework for building complex data processing pipelines. Each stage takes in documents as input and outputs transformed documents for the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Security Features**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB offers robust security features, including authentication, authorization, encryption (both at rest and in transit), and auditing. These features help ensure data protection and compliance with security standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Developer-Friendly**\n",
    "- **Explanation:** MongoDB is designed to be easy to use for developers, with a rich set of drivers and libraries for various programming languages, a powerful query language, and a flexible data model that adapts to evolving application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a versatile and powerful database solution for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems."

    "- **Function Signature:** `delete_one(filter, collation=None, hint=None, session=None)`\n",
    "- **Returns:** A `DeleteResult` object, which includes the number of documents deleted (accessible via `deleted_count`).\n",

    "#### `drop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Signature:** `drop(session=None)`\n",

    "   print(f\"Deleted {result.deleted_count} document(s)\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This deletes all documents where `age` is greater than 30.\n",

    "3. **Drop the Collection:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   collection.drop()\n",
    "   print(\"Collection dropped\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This deletes the entire `my_collection` collection from the `my_database` database.\n",
