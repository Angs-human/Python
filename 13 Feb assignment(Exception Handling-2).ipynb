    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is important to inherit from the base `Exception` class for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization**:\n",
    "   - **Structure and Behavior**: The `Exception` class provides a standard structure for all exceptions, ensuring that your custom exception has the necessary attributes and methods expected of an exception in Python.\n",
    "   - **Consistency**: Inheriting from the `Exception` class ensures that your custom exception behaves like built-in exceptions, maintaining consistency across your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - **Try-Except Blocks**: Python’s error handling mechanisms (`try`...`except` blocks) are designed to work with instances of the `BaseException` class and its subclasses, including `Exception`. By inheriting from `Exception`, your custom exception can be caught and handled properly using these mechanisms.\n",
    "   - **Hierarchical Catching**: Inheriting from `Exception` allows for hierarchical catching of exceptions. This means you can catch specific exceptions or more general ones higher up in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interoperability**:\n",
    "   - **Third-Party Libraries**: Many third-party libraries and frameworks expect exceptions to inherit from the `Exception` class. By following this convention, your custom exceptions can be used seamlessly with these libraries.\n",
    "   - **Integration with Built-in Functions**: Built-in functions that work with exceptions, such as `raise` and `assert`, expect exceptions to be derived from `Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - **Custom Attributes and Methods**: Inheriting from `Exception` allows you to extend the functionality of the base class by adding custom attributes and methods to your custom exception. This can provide additional context or functionality specific to your error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - **Readable and Maintainable Code**: Following the standard practice of inheriting from `Exception` makes your code more readable and maintainable for other developers who are familiar with Python’s exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `Exception` class as the base for your custom exceptions, you ensure that your exceptions integrate smoothly with Python’s built-in error handling mechanisms and adhere to standard practices, making your code more robust and reliable."

This class is not typically used directly; instead, it provides a common ancestor for exceptions that occur when a lookup operation fails, such as accessing elements in a dictionary or a list. The two primary subclasses of `LookupError` are `KeyError` and `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `KeyError`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `KeyError` is raised when a dictionary key is not found in the set of existing keys.\n",

    "### 2. `IndexError`\n",
    "\n",
    "An `IndexError` is raised when a sequence subscript is out of range, such as when trying to access an index that does not exist in a list.\n",

    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Avoid Catching General Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions to handle anticipated errors and avoid catching `Exception` or `BaseException` unless absolutely necessary. This helps in pinpointing the exact issue and prevents hiding unexpected bugs.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         result = 10 / 0\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "     except ValueError:\n",
    "         print(\"ValueError occurred.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use `finally` for Cleanup**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Ensure Cleanup**: Use the `finally` block to ensure that cleanup actions (e.g., closing files, releasing resources) are executed regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         file = open('file.txt', 'r')\n",
    "         data = file.read()\n",
    "     except IOError:\n",
    "         print(\"File read error.\")\n",
    "     finally:\n",
    "         file.close()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Log Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Logging**: Use the `logging` module to log exception details. This helps in diagnosing issues and keeping a record of errors.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         result = 10 / 0\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "         logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Avoid Bare `except` Clauses**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Be Explicit**: Avoid using bare `except` clauses because they catch all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`. This can hide serious issues.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # risky code\n",
    "     except Exception as e:\n",
    "         print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Provide Useful Error Messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Contextual Information**: Provide clear and informative error messages to help understand what went wrong and why.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         value = int(\"abc\")\n",
    "     except ValueError as e:\n",
    "         print(f\"Conversion failed. Invalid input: {e}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Handle Exceptions at the Right Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Granular Handling**: Handle exceptions at the level where you can take appropriate action or recover from the error, rather than at a higher level where you might not have enough context.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def process_data(data):\n",
    "         try:\n",
    "             # processing code\n",
    "         except KeyError:\n",
    "             print(\"Key error during data processing.\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "     def main():\n",
    "         try:\n",
    "             process_data(data)\n",
    "         except Exception as e:\n",
    "             print(f\"An error occurred in main: {e}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Reraise Exceptions When Necessary**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Preserve Exception Information**: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it fully, consider using `raise` to propagate it upwards.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "     except SomeException as e:\n",
    "         # Log the exception or handle it partially\n",
    "         raise  # Re-raise the exception\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Use Custom Exceptions for Specific Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions in your application. This can make error handling more precise and meaningful.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error.\")\n",
    "     except CustomError as e:\n",
    "         print(f\"Caught a custom error: {e}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Use `else` with `try`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Code Execution**: Use the `else` block after `try` and `except` to execute code that should run only if no exception was raised.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         result = 10 / 2\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         print(f\"Division successful. Result: {result}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Avoid Exception-Based Flow Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Use Exceptions Sparingly**: Exceptions should not be used for regular control flow. Use conditionals for expected situations and exceptions for truly exceptional cases.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Avoid doing this\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         value = some_list[index]\n",
    "     except IndexError:\n",
    "         value = default_value\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Better approach\n",
    "     if index < len(some_list):\n",
    "         value = some_list[index]\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         value = default_value\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable code that handles errors gracefully and provides clear information about issues."
