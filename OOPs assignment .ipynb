    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. A class defines the characteristics and behaviors that objects of that class will have. The characteristics are represented by the data members or attributes of the class, while the behaviors are represented by the member functions or methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class called \"Car\" that represents a car in a car rental system. The Car class would have attributes such as make, model, color, and year, and methods such as start_engine(), stop_engine(), accelerate(), and brake(). These attributes and methods define what a Car object is and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that is created using the blueprint defined by the class. Each object has its own set of attribute values, which are independent of other objects of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the car rental system example, an object of the Car class could be a specific car that a customer has rented, such as a 2019 Toyota Corolla in blue. This object would have its own set of attribute values for make, model, color, and year, as well as its own state regarding whether the engine is running, its current speed, etc.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This is the principle of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. Encapsulation helps to ensure that the internal state of an object is not modified directly by external code, and that changes to the implementation of an object do not affect other parts of the code that use the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This is the mechanism by which a new class is created from an existing class, inheriting the attributes and behaviors of the parent class. Inheritance allows for code reuse and promotes the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of a common parent class. Polymorphism allows for code to be written that can work with objects of different types, as long as they implement a common interface or have a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: This is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object and ignoring the irrelevant details. Abstraction helps to simplify complex systems by focusing on the high-level structure and behavior of objects, while ignoring the implementation details. It is closely related to encapsulation, in that it helps to define a clear public interface for an object."
