    "In Python, an **exception** is a special object that indicates something went wrong during the execution of your code. When an error occurs, Python creates an exception object and raises it, which can then be caught and handled using `try` and `except` blocks. This mechanism helps to manage errors and maintain control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points about Exceptions:\n",
    "1. **Types of Exceptions**: Python has many built-in exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, etc. You can also define your own custom exceptions by subclassing the built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "2. **Handling Exceptions**: You handle exceptions using `try` and `except` blocks. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       # code that runs if the exception occurs\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors vs. Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Syntax errors occur when the code you write does not conform to the grammar rules of Python. This is detected by the Python interpreter before the code is even executed.\n",
    "- **Detection**: Syntax errors are detected at compile time, meaning before the program runs. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(\"Hello world\"  # Missing closing parenthesis\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This will cause a syntax error, and the code won't run at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def my_function()\n",
    "      print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This code will produce a syntax error because the function definition is missing a colon (`:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exceptions:**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Exceptions are runtime errors that occur while the code is executing. They are raised when the interpreter encounters an error during execution, such as attempting to divide by zero or trying to access a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "- **Detection**: Exceptions are detected at runtime, meaning during the execution of the program. For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      result = 10 / 0\n",
    "  except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "      print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  In this case, the program will handle the division by zero exception and continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      number = int(\"abc\")  # Raises a ValueError\n",
    "  except ValueError:\n",
    "      print(\"Invalid conversion.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors** are detected at compile time and prevent the code from running.\n",
    "- **Exceptions** are detected at runtime and can be handled within the program to allow it to continue running."

    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it leads to the termination of the program or script. This occurs because the Python interpreter doesn't know how to handle the error, so it propagates the exception up the call stack. If the exception remains unhandled, Python will display a traceback of the error and terminate the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Unhandled Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple Python script with an unhandled exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the function with zero as the divisor\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: The `divide_numbers` function attempts to divide `a` by `b`.\n",
    "2. **Function Call**: The function is called with `10` and `0` as arguments. Since division by zero is mathematically undefined, this will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When the script is executed, the Python interpreter will raise an exception because division by zero is not allowed. Since the exception is not handled, the script will produce a traceback and terminate. The output will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Traceback\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traceback**: This part shows the call stack at the point where the exception occurred. It helps to understand the sequence of function calls leading up to the error.\n",
    "- **File and Line Number**: The traceback specifies the file (`example.py`) and line numbers (`line 5` and `line 2`) where the error occurred.\n",
    "- **Exception Type and Message**: At the end, you see the type of exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) and a descriptive message (`division by zero`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Handle the Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the program from terminating and to handle the error gracefully, you can use a `try` and `except` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return a / b\n",

    "result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output with Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception handling added, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "Result: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unhandled Exception**: Causes the program to terminate and prints a traceback.\n",
    "- **Handled Exception**: Allows the program to continue running and can provide meaningful error messages or alternative actions.\n",

    "In Python, exceptions are caught and handled using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements. Each of these plays a specific role in managing exceptions and controlling the flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**: Contains the code that might raise an exception. The `try` block allows you to test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "2. **`except` Block**: Catches and handles the exception if one occurs in the `try` block. You can specify particular exception types or catch all exceptions.\n",
    "3. **`else` Block**: Optional. If no exceptions occur in the `try` block, the `else` block will execute. It's useful for code that should only run if no errors were encountered.\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block**: Optional. Contains code that will always run, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",

    "   - **`except TypeError`**: Catches errors where the inputs are not numbers and prints a message.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **`else` Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block, indicating successful division.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, providing a message indicating the end of the operation.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - `InsufficientFundsError` and `AccountNotFoundError` are custom exceptions that inherit from `Exception`. They provide specific error messages to be used when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - In the `BankAccount` class, the `withdraw` method raises an `InsufficientFundsError` if an attempt is made to withdraw more money than available.\n",
    "   - The `check_account` method raises an `AccountNotFoundError` if the account ID does not match the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - The `try` and `except` blocks catch these specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, providing clear feedback about the nature of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions are essential for creating more expressive and manageable error handling in your programs. They allow you to define precise error types and handle specific conditions effectively, leading to clearer, more maintainable code."

    "### Creating a Custom Exception Class\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll define a custom exception class called `InvalidAgeError` which will be used to handle cases where an invalid age is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the custom exception class\n",
    "class InvalidAgeError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised for errors in the provided age.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age, message=\"Age must be a positive integer and at least 1 year old.\"):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.message} Provided age: {self.age}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function that raises the custom exception if the age is invalid\n",
    "def register_user(name, age):\n",
    "    if age <= 0:\n",
    "        raise InvalidAgeError(age, \"Age cannot be zero or negative.\")\n",
    "    elif age < 1:\n",
    "        raise InvalidAgeError(age, \"Age must be at least 1 year old.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"User {name} registered successfully with age {age}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Attempt to register a user with an invalid age\n",
    "    register_user(\"Alice\", -5)  # This will raise InvalidAgeError\n",
    "except InvalidAgeError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Class**:\n",
    "   - `InvalidAgeError` inherits from Python’s built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "   - It has an `__init__` method to initialize the error message and store the invalid age.\n",
    "   - The `__str__` method provides a string representation of the error, including the invalid age.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Using the Custom Exception**:\n",
    "   - `register_user` checks if the provided age is valid.\n",
    "   - If the age is invalid (e.g., zero or negative), it raises an `InvalidAgeError` with an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling the Custom Exception**:\n",
    "   - In the `try` block, we attempt to register a user with an invalid age.\n",
    "   - The `except` block catches the `InvalidAgeError` and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Caught an error: Age cannot be zero or negative. Provided age: -5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Exception Class**: `InvalidAgeError` is defined to handle specific age-related errors.\n",
    "- **Using the Custom Exception**: The `register_user` function raises `InvalidAgeError` for invalid age inputs.\n",
    "- **Handling the Exception**: The `try` and `except` blocks catch and handle the custom exception, providing a meaningful error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes your error handling more specific and expressive, allowing for clearer and more manageable code."
